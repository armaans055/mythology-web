            <p>Hello, if you are viewing this, it is my Mythologies of the World final project, I have created a website composed of my favorite Greek Myths, Heroes, and Creatures, although there are a lot more than mentioned on this website, it would take a long time to list them all. So I have only listed my favorites. A little bit of background, Greek Mythology is the body of myths told by the ancient Greeks, and it concerns the ancient Greekreligion's view of the origin and nature of the world. It can also be accounted for the explanation of many natural events in the eyes of the Greek.</p>

            <p>Although Herodotus doesn't relate to Greek Mythology, I wanted to mention him because of his importance in history as a whole, Herodotus is often referred to as "The Father of History" and this Greek Historian and Geographer wrote Histories a detailed account of the Greco-Persian Wars.
