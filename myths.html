            The myth of Icarus is a famous Greek legend about ambition and hubris. Icarus and his father Daedalus were imprisoned on the island of Crete, and to escape, Daedalus crafted wings made of feathers and wax for both of them. Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun, but Icarus, caught up in the thrill of flight, ignored the warning. The sun melted the wax on his wings, causing Icarus to fall into the sea and drown. The lesson is greed! And it is directly related to the phrase, 'flew too close to the sun' <sup>Image from Wikipedia</sup></p>

            <p>The myth of Sisyphus is another well-known tale from Greek mythology, centered around the theme of eternal struggle and futility. Sisyphus was a clever and deceitful king who angered the gods with his trickery, including cheating death twice. As punishment, he was condemned by the gods to roll a huge boulder up a steep hill in the underworld, only for it to roll back down each time he neared the top. This endless task symbolizes a futile endeavor, where success is always just out of reach. The lesson from Sisyphus's story is often seen as a warning against overreaching hubris and the futility of attempting to outsmart or defy the natural <sup>Image from Wikipedia</sup></p>

            <p>The myth of Prometheus is a pivotal story in Greek mythology, highlighting themes of foresight, rebellion, and the quest for knowledge. Prometheus, a Titan known for his intelligence, defied the gods by stealing fire from Olympus and giving it to humanity, an act that symbolized the awakening of human civilization and progress. This angered Zeus, the king of the gods, who saw Prometheus' act as a challenge to divine authority. As punishment, Zeus had Prometheus bound to a rock, where an eagle would eat his liver every day, only for it to regenerate each night, causing endless suffering. The story of Prometheus teaches about the risks and consequences of challenging authority and the pursuit of knowledge, as well as the enduring human spirit in the face of suffering. <sup>Image from Wikipedia</sup></p>

            <p>The myth of Achilles, a central figure in Greek mythology and the Trojan War, revolves around themes of heroism, vulnerability, and fate. Achilles was a mighty warrior, said to be invulnerable everywhere except for his heel, where his mother Thetis held him when she dipped him in the River Styx as a baby to make him invincible. He achieved great fame and glory during the Trojan War, but his pride and anger often drove his actions, leading to both triumphs and tragedies. Achilles' eventual death, caused by an arrow to his heel, fulfills his destiny and highlights the concept of a singular, fatal weakness. The story of Achilles teaches about the balance of strength and vulnerability, the consequences of pride, and the inevitability of fate. <sup>Image from Wikipedia</sup></p>

            <p>In Greek mythology, the story of Pandora's Box serves as a cautionary tale about curiosity and disobedience. Created by the gods, Pandora was bestowed with a box and warned never to open it. However, her curiosity overpowered her, and she eventually lifted the lid, unwittingly unleashing all the sorrows and miseries of humanity into the world. These included illness, poverty, and other unknown evils that were previously absent. In a moment of realization and quick action, Pandora closed the box, managing to trap Hope inside, thereby leaving humanity with at least one solace amid the chaos. <sup>Image from the Encyclopedia of History</sup></p>
